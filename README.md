# Frontend Mentor - Intro Component with Sign Up Form
Overview This is my solution to the Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a responsive sign-up form with form validation and a smooth user experience across devices.

ðŸš€ Features âœ… Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screens

âœ… Real-time password visibility toggle

âœ… Form validation with custom error alerts:

All fields required

Email must follow valid format (name@domain.com)

âœ… Redirects to a confirmation page after successful submission

âœ… Keyboard accessibility (pressing Enter inside password field submits the form)

ðŸ›  Technologies Used HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

JavaScript (Vanilla)

ðŸ“± Responsive Design Mobile responsiveness is handled using media queries. The layout adapts to smaller screens by stacking sections vertically.

ðŸ§  What I Learned Implementing client-side validation manually

Working with dynamic DOM interactions (show/hide password)

Structuring clean, maintainable HTML/CSS for components

Handling form flow and user feedback
